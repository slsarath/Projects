🎯 Refined Self-Introduction (VP Interview – Internal at Barclays)

“Hi, I’m Sarath. I come with over a decade of experience in data science and analytics, primarily within the financial services sector, focusing on risk, compliance, and control assurance. Prior to Barclays, I worked at HSBC, where I led a team of data analysts delivering AML and compliance monitoring solutions using machine learning.

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics setup within the Control Assurance team was still in its early stages — just a 6-member team. Over the last two years, I’ve been part of its transformation into a global function with 23+ members, and have played a key role in developing NLP-driven models, control testing automations, and predictive analytics solutions that support assurance activities across various business lines.

While I currently work as an individual contributor, I bring prior people management and mentoring experience from HSBC. This year, a significant part of my focus has been on PBWM initiatives, where I’ve contributed analytical solutions and insights to strengthen control design and coverage.

I’m also closely involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, where we’re starting with configuration standards and building out scalable frameworks. Among the various models I’ve developed, the Issue Root Cause Analysis model has been the most impactful — it’s been widely recognized across the business and earned me recognition from the Group Control Head. It has enabled faster, consistent, and data-driven identification of systemic issues across functions.

Across all my projects, I’ve focused on embedding proactive control assurance — enabling the identification and mitigation of risks before they materialize. I aim to create solutions that are not just technically sound, but aligned with regulatory expectations, explainable to auditors, and trusted by the business. This VP role feels like the right next step to extend that impact further — by taking on broader leadership responsibilities and helping shape the future of risk-aware, intelligent assurance at Barclays.”

🎯 Self-Introduction Script (VP Interview – Barclays)

“Hi, I’m Sarath. I bring over 10 years of experience in data science and analytics, primarily in the financial services domain, with a strong focus on risk, compliance, and control assurance.

Before joining Barclays, I worked at HSBC where I led a team of data analysts delivering AML and compliance monitoring models. That leadership experience really shaped my collaborative style — balancing technical delivery with mentoring and stakeholder engagement.

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics team in Control Assurance was still very new — just a 6-member setup. Over the past two years, I’ve been part of scaling it into a global function with 23+ members. I’ve had the opportunity to lead and deliver several impactful solutions — from NLP-driven root cause models and control testing automation, to predictive insights across business lines.

Currently, I operate as an individual contributor, but I work very closely with cross-functional teams, business SMEs, and senior stakeholders. One of my key strengths has been translating complex analytical concepts into business-aligned, explainable outputs — especially in assurance reviews.

This year, I’ve focused primarily on PBWM initiatives, supporting control design with analytics. Alongside, I’ve also been involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, starting with configuration standards — helping create a scalable, control-focused framework from the ground up.

Among my most recognized contributions is the Issue Root Cause Analysis model, which uses NLP and semantic search to proactively identify systemic issues from risk and issue narratives. It’s been widely adopted across the business and was acknowledged by the Group Control Head for its impact on proactive risk management.

What ties all this together is my focus on building solutions that are technically robust, operationally scalable, and aligned with regulatory expectations. I strongly believe in proactive assurance — identifying and mitigating risk before it materializes — and embedding explainability and trust into everything we build.

Outside of work, I’m a national-level football player, which taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and pushing through challenges. I also enjoy writing blogs on data science and AI, and often spend weekends trekking, which helps me reset and stay curious. These pursuits reflect the mindset I bring into my work — structured, balanced, and always learning.

I see this VP opportunity as a natural progression — a chance to take broader ownership, mentor upcoming talent, and contribute more strategically to our risk-aware, data-driven future here at Barclays.”

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics function in Control Assurance was still in its early stages — just a 6-member team. Over the past two years, I’ve contributed to scaling it into a global function with 23+ members. I’ve played a core role in delivering NLP-driven root cause models, automating control testing, and building predictive analytics solutions that support assurance reviews across multiple business lines.

While I currently operate as an individual contributor, I work extensively with cross-functional teams, business SMEs, and senior stakeholders. One of my key strengths has been translating technical models into meaningful, business-aligned insights — especially during assurance reviews and control deep-dives.

This year, I’ve focused heavily on PBWM initiatives, supporting control design through analytics. Alongside that, I’ve been involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, where we’re currently building out scalable frameworks starting with configuration standards.

Among my most impactful contributions is the Issue Root Cause Analysis model — an NLP and semantic search–based solution that proactively identifies root causes from issue and risk narratives. This model is now widely used across the business and was recognized by the Group Control Head for its value in enabling proactive risk management and consistent issue analysis.

In addition to my project work, I’m passionate about colleague engagement and upskilling. I’ve organized and led multiple knowledge-sharing sessions, helped junior analysts with Python and NLP techniques, and created reusable code templates to improve team productivity. I also actively encourage cross-pollination of ideas across regions by initiating informal “data connect” forums and supporting ideation during assurance week and hackathons.

What ties everything together is my focus on building solutions that are technically strong, transparent, and regulatory-aligned. I strongly believe in proactive assurance — identifying and mitigating risk before it materializes — and embedding explainability, trust, and reusability in every model we build.

Outside of work, I’m a national-level football player, which taught me discipline, resilience, and team spirit. I also write blogs on data science and AI, and spend weekends trekking, which helps me stay curious and grounded. These hobbies mirror my professional mindset — structured, collaborative, and constantly evolving.

I see this VP opportunity as a natural next step — to expand my influence, mentor at a larger scale, and contribute strategically to our vision of a risk-aware, data-driven Barclays.”
