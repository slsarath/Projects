üéØ Refined Self-Introduction (VP Interview ‚Äì Internal at Barclays)

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Sarath. I come with over a decade of experience in data science and analytics, primarily within the financial services sector, focusing on risk, compliance, and control assurance. Prior to Barclays, I worked at HSBC, where I led a team of data analysts delivering AML and compliance monitoring solutions using machine learning.

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics setup within the Control Assurance team was still in its early stages ‚Äî just a 6-member team. Over the last two years, I‚Äôve been part of its transformation into a global function with 23+ members, and have played a key role in developing NLP-driven models, control testing automations, and predictive analytics solutions that support assurance activities across various business lines.

While I currently work as an individual contributor, I bring prior people management and mentoring experience from HSBC. This year, a significant part of my focus has been on PBWM initiatives, where I‚Äôve contributed analytical solutions and insights to strengthen control design and coverage.

I‚Äôm also closely involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, where we‚Äôre starting with configuration standards and building out scalable frameworks. Among the various models I‚Äôve developed, the Issue Root Cause Analysis model has been the most impactful ‚Äî it‚Äôs been widely recognized across the business and earned me recognition from the Group Control Head. It has enabled faster, consistent, and data-driven identification of systemic issues across functions.

Across all my projects, I‚Äôve focused on embedding proactive control assurance ‚Äî enabling the identification and mitigation of risks before they materialize. I aim to create solutions that are not just technically sound, but aligned with regulatory expectations, explainable to auditors, and trusted by the business. This VP role feels like the right next step to extend that impact further ‚Äî by taking on broader leadership responsibilities and helping shape the future of risk-aware, intelligent assurance at Barclays.‚Äù

üéØ Self-Introduction Script (VP Interview ‚Äì Barclays)

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Sarath. I bring over 10 years of experience in data science and analytics, primarily in the financial services domain, with a strong focus on risk, compliance, and control assurance.

Before joining Barclays, I worked at HSBC where I led a team of data analysts delivering AML and compliance monitoring models. That leadership experience really shaped my collaborative style ‚Äî balancing technical delivery with mentoring and stakeholder engagement.

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics team in Control Assurance was still very new ‚Äî just a 6-member setup. Over the past two years, I‚Äôve been part of scaling it into a global function with 23+ members. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to lead and deliver several impactful solutions ‚Äî from NLP-driven root cause models and control testing automation, to predictive insights across business lines.

Currently, I operate as an individual contributor, but I work very closely with cross-functional teams, business SMEs, and senior stakeholders. One of my key strengths has been translating complex analytical concepts into business-aligned, explainable outputs ‚Äî especially in assurance reviews.

This year, I‚Äôve focused primarily on PBWM initiatives, supporting control design with analytics. Alongside, I‚Äôve also been involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, starting with configuration standards ‚Äî helping create a scalable, control-focused framework from the ground up.

Among my most recognized contributions is the Issue Root Cause Analysis model, which uses NLP and semantic search to proactively identify systemic issues from risk and issue narratives. It‚Äôs been widely adopted across the business and was acknowledged by the Group Control Head for its impact on proactive risk management.

What ties all this together is my focus on building solutions that are technically robust, operationally scalable, and aligned with regulatory expectations. I strongly believe in proactive assurance ‚Äî identifying and mitigating risk before it materializes ‚Äî and embedding explainability and trust into everything we build.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a national-level football player, which taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and pushing through challenges. I also enjoy writing blogs on data science and AI, and often spend weekends trekking, which helps me reset and stay curious. These pursuits reflect the mindset I bring into my work ‚Äî structured, balanced, and always learning.

I see this VP opportunity as a natural progression ‚Äî a chance to take broader ownership, mentor upcoming talent, and contribute more strategically to our risk-aware, data-driven future here at Barclays.‚Äù
