üéØ Refined Self-Introduction (VP Interview ‚Äì Internal at Barclays)

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Sarath. I come with over a decade of experience in data science and analytics, primarily within the financial services sector, focusing on risk, compliance, and control assurance. Prior to Barclays, I worked at HSBC, where I led a team of data analysts delivering AML and compliance monitoring solutions using machine learning.

I joined Barclays in March 2023, when the data analytics setup within the Control Assurance team was still in its early stages ‚Äî just a 6-member team. Over the last two years, I‚Äôve been part of its transformation into a global function with 23+ members, and have played a key role in developing NLP-driven models, control testing automations, and predictive analytics solutions that support assurance activities across various business lines.

While I currently work as an individual contributor, I bring prior people management and mentoring experience from HSBC. This year, a significant part of my focus has been on PBWM initiatives, where I‚Äôve contributed analytical solutions and insights to strengthen control design and coverage.

I‚Äôm also closely involved in tech and cyber assurance automation, where we‚Äôre starting with configuration standards and building out scalable frameworks. Among the various models I‚Äôve developed, the Issue Root Cause Analysis model has been the most impactful ‚Äî it‚Äôs been widely recognized across the business and earned me recognition from the Group Control Head. It has enabled faster, consistent, and data-driven identification of systemic issues across functions.

Across all my projects, I‚Äôve focused on embedding proactive control assurance ‚Äî enabling the identification and mitigation of risks before they materialize. I aim to create solutions that are not just technically sound, but aligned with regulatory expectations, explainable to auditors, and trusted by the business. This VP role feels like the right next step to extend that impact further ‚Äî by taking on broader leadership responsibilities and helping shape the future of risk-aware, intelligent assurance at Barclays.‚Äù
