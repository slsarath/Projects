Perfect — now it’s clear. You’ve got a labeled dataset (though quite imbalanced) with 8494 transcripts, sentiment, cost, and AWS tags. Your task is essentially:

Build a reliable way to classify dissatisfied calls into Complaint vs Concern (and possibly detect mis-labeled/NaNs).

Here’s how I’d structure the work:

⸻

1. Understand the labels and imbalance
	•	Most data is NaN (≈70%), with Concerns (19%) and Complaints (10%).
	•	This means you’ll need to decide whether NaNs are truly unlabeled (ignore during training) or actually “Query/Other”.

👉 First step: separate NaN rows and keep Complaint/Concern as your supervised training set.

⸻

2. Preprocessing the transcripts
	•	Clean text → remove headers like Agent/Customer, punctuation, filler words if noisy.
	•	Preserve conversational structure if useful (complaints often start with “I want to raise a complaint” or “I am not happy because…”).
	•	Normalize text (lowercasing, lemmatization).
	•	Consider splitting into customer-only utterances (since dissatisfaction comes from them).

⸻

3. Feature engineering

Use multiple signals, not just text:

a) Text features
	•	TF-IDF / embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, or even domain-specific FinBERT).
	•	Keywords/phrases that strongly indicate complaint (refund, compensation, loss, FCA, complaint, not acceptable) vs concern (query, help, forgot pin, need replacement).

b) Sentiment score
	•	Complaints likely cluster toward negative scores (-5 to -2).
	•	Concerns may be mildly negative (-1 to +1).

c) Financial impact (“Total cost”)
	•	If >0 or high → tilts toward Complaint.
	•	If =0 → often Concern.

d) AWS tag category (from your screenshots)
	•	Strong feature. Many tags already hint complaint vs concern.
	•	E.g. Refund, Financial Difficulties → Complaint; Pin, Card Replacement → Concern.

4. Modeling strategy

Since you’ve got a mix of structured + unstructured data:
	•	Baseline model: Logistic Regression / Random Forest on TF-IDF text + sentiment + cost + tags.
	•	Advanced model: Fine-tuned transformer (BERT/FinBERT) with additional features concatenated.
	•	Try multi-input architecture (text encoder + numeric features).

⸻

5. Dealing with imbalance
	•	Use class weights or SMOTE to handle Complaint < Concern.
	•	Evaluate with F1-score per class, not accuracy (accuracy will be misleading given imbalance).

⸻

6. Validation & Explainability
	•	Do stratified train-test split.
	•	Use SHAP or feature importance to see what drives Complaint vs Concern.
	•	Validate outputs against definitions: does the model flag financial loss / material upset correctly?

⸻

7. Next steps after model
	•	Use the trained classifier to auto-label the 5975 NaNs.
	•	Manually validate a subset to check precision.
	•	Feed back into your labeling loop for better coverage.

⸻

✅ In short:
	1.	Clean transcripts, split labeled vs unlabeled.
	2.	Engineer features (text + sentiment + cost + AWS tags).
	3.	Train baseline models, then move to embeddings.
	4.	Balance classes + evaluate with F1.
	5.	Use model to predict on unlabeled (NaNs).

Do you want me to sketch a concrete pipeline in Python (step-by-step) for this so you could actually implement it, or would you prefer I keep it high-level strategy for now?
