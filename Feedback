Thank you again for your time today — I really enjoyed our conversation. May I know who I should follow up with regarding the next steps or feedback from this interview?

Here’s a strong, professional answer to “Are you okay to work from the UK — and why?”, especially tailored to someone at VP level interviewing internally within Barclays:

✅ Sample Answer

“Yes, I’m absolutely open to working from the UK if the role requires it. From my perspective, being closer to the core teams, key stakeholders, and strategic decision-making hubs can be a valuable advantage — especially in a senior role like this, where cross-functional collaboration and alignment with global priorities are critical.

I also see it as a great opportunity for personal and professional growth — being part of a new environment, building stronger global networks, and gaining exposure to regulatory expectations and operational models specific to the region. I’m confident I can adapt quickly and continue contributing effectively from day one.”
