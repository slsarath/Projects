✅ Example Answer – Challenges Faced in Root Cause Analysis Project

“One of the most rewarding yet challenging projects I’ve worked on was the Issue Root Cause Analysis model at Barclays. While the final outcome was highly successful and well received, we did encounter several challenges along the way — both technical and operational.

First, the inconsistency in narrative quality across risk and issue records was a major hurdle. Some entries were well-detailed, while others were vague or lacked structure, making it difficult for an NLP model to interpret meaningfully. To address this, we designed preprocessing techniques like dependency parsing and created custom rules to extract negative action phrases — improving the model’s sensitivity to root cause signals.

Second, getting alignment on the L1 and L2 taxonomy for root causes wasn’t straightforward. Different teams had different interpretations of what constitutes a “human error” vs. “process failure.” We overcame this through stakeholder workshops, SME reviews, and iterative validation rounds to refine the phrase bank and classification criteria.

Third, there was initial resistance from some control teams who were unsure whether a model could consistently replace judgment-based tagging. To build trust, we ran side-by-side comparisons with manually reviewed cases, presented accuracy metrics, and built in human-in-the-loop checkpoints. This helped gain credibility and buy-in.

Lastly, integrating the solution into Tableau and getting consistent refresh cycles in place required coordination with multiple downstream data teams and agreement on ownership. It wasn’t just about building the model — it was about embedding it into business processes, with governance and scalability.

These challenges taught me the importance of patience, structured stakeholder engagement, and balancing automation with interpretability. Ultimately, overcoming them strengthened the model, made it more robust, and enhanced its acceptance across the business.”
