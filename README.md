✅ Example Answer – Challenges Faced in Root Cause Analysis Project

“One of the most rewarding yet challenging projects I’ve worked on was the Issue Root Cause Analysis model at Barclays. While the final outcome was highly successful and well received, we did encounter several challenges along the way — both technical and operational.

First, the inconsistency in narrative quality across risk and issue records was a major hurdle. Some entries were well-detailed, while others were vague or lacked structure, making it difficult for an NLP model to interpret meaningfully. To address this, we designed preprocessing techniques like dependency parsing and created custom rules to extract negative action phrases — improving the model’s sensitivity to root cause signals.

Second, getting alignment on the L1 and L2 taxonomy for root causes wasn’t straightforward. Different teams had different interpretations of what constitutes a “human error” vs. “process failure.” We overcame this through stakeholder workshops, SME reviews, and iterative validation rounds to refine the phrase bank and classification criteria.

Third, there was initial resistance from some control teams who were unsure whether a model could consistently replace judgment-based tagging. To build trust, we ran side-by-side comparisons with manually reviewed cases, presented accuracy metrics, and built in human-in-the-loop checkpoints. This helped gain credibility and buy-in.

Lastly, integrating the solution into Tableau and getting consistent refresh cycles in place required coordination with multiple downstream data teams and agreement on ownership. It wasn’t just about building the model — it was about embedding it into business processes, with governance and scalability.

These challenges taught me the importance of patience, structured stakeholder engagement, and balancing automation with interpretability. Ultimately, overcoming them strengthened the model, made it more robust, and enhanced its acceptance across the business.”

Here’s a strategic and balanced answer to the question:
“Why do you want to move from your current AVP role to this VP position?”
— especially tailored for an internal move at Barclays.

✅ Sample Answer

“I’ve really valued my journey so far as an AVP here at Barclays. Over the past couple of years, I’ve had the opportunity to deliver impactful solutions — from control testing automation to NLP-based root cause analysis — and collaborate closely with both the assurance and risk teams globally.

That said, I feel I’m at a point where I’m ready to take on broader ownership and strategic responsibility. The VP role aligns well with the direction I’ve been naturally growing into — leading more cross-functional initiatives, mentoring colleagues, and shaping data-driven decision-making at scale.

What excites me about this opportunity is the chance to move from delivering solutions to shaping the roadmap, contributing at the leadership level, and ensuring our analytics efforts are not only innovative but also well-aligned with risk governance and regulatory expectations. I want to help connect the dots between assurance insights, emerging risks, and data strategy — and I see this role as the right platform to do that.

Since it’s an internal move, I’m also confident I can hit the ground running, while continuing to build on the relationships and context I already have across the business.”
